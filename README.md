# The-Greedy-Tour
The project aims to solve one of the criteria of ITS(Intelligent Transport Systems) ie., to find efficient paths based on time travel.
 -  The user can use the platform to enter a source and destination.
 -  The output is a feasible path which takes shortest time to travel.
 -  The main idea of project is to solve this problem using graph algorithms like Dijkstra's algorithm.

# INSTRUCTION TO RUN
- The files need to be on a unix based web server where the executable file after compiling the .cpp file needs to present.
- The executable name should be "Run" (without Quotes and .exe extension).
- Now the application requires a good internet connection.
- The application can be accessed through ProjectWeb.html page.
